# BrickBreaker
A brick Breaker game that follows the instructions given in classes and online.
This game is practice to better understand C# and Unity as a whole and gain better knowledge of game design work flow. 
I hope to make a brick destroying game and use AI Tools to help me take on the task much faster.
